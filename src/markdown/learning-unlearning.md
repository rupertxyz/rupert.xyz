Every day we learn and unlearn â€” unconsciously, without taking notice.

Many things are worth unlearning. For instance the ability of excessively worrying about things outside of our control.

Many things are worth learning. Skills that make us stronger, wealthier or better able to connect with others.

Most importantly perhaps, what we learn and unlearn is a result of our systems, our habits, our surroundings. Intentionally focussing on those and their impact on what we learn and unlearn makes a lot of sense.

Being intentional about what to learn and unlearn is powerful.
